== Introduction

Task Manager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*.
More importantly, Task Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a keyboard rather than a mouse*.
Do you want to organise and prioritise your tasks and never miss a single deadline again? Enjoy!

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TaskManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try the following commands:

* *`list`* : shows a list of all tasks in the Task Manager
* *`add n/Assignment m/CG2027 d/12-02 p/1`* : adds a task named `Assignment` of module `CG2023`, due date `12-02` and priority level `1` to the Task Manager.
