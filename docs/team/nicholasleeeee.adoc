== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *login function*
** What it does: allows the user create an account by signing up. Upon signing up, subsequent logins will allow the user to access their personal taskmanager.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have their tasks secured without anyone messing with it.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Changed files to binary file
