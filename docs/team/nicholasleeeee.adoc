== Nicholas Lee - Project Portfolio
=== Overview

|===
This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a Software Engineering project for 2113T.
The team consist of 4 members and we were tasked to develop a working application within 12 weeks.
Throughout the project, we were challenged to incorporate a Software Engineering project into a product of our own.

Our team have decided to come up with Student Buddy. Student Buddy is an application that is used for university students to view, sort and manage their tasks effectively.

In Student Buddy, students interact via the CLI or GUI that is created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10kLoC.

=== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement: added login feature*

_What it does:_ +
Allows the user to create a personal account by signing up.
Upon signing up, the user is able to sign in and logout whenever they want to.
Subsequent login will allow the user to access their personal Student Buddy.
With an normal account, only a logged in user will be able to add, edit or delete tasks in their Student Buddy.

_Justification:_ +
This feature improves the product significantly because a user
can have their tasks secured without anyone messing with it.

_Highlights:_ +
This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

_Credits: GSON Java library_ +
Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
In Student Buddy, GSON Java library is used to convert the account's username and password,
which is in Java Object form, into JSON representation to be stored in a JSON file.
Vice versa, for retrieving the JSON representation in the JSON file and converting
into Java Objects to be read by other classes.

*Minor enhancement:* +
1. All passwords are hashed before storing. +
2. Added admin feature. +
3. An admin is able to delete user accounts. +
4. An admin is able to use any commands like a normal user.

=== Contributions to the User Guide

_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== Signing up for an account : `signup`

*Creates an account for the user. To `signup`, there must be no existing account.* +

* Only one account can be created per user.

* Passwords should not have spaces and may only include the following special characters: +
!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^.@-

Format: `signup u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD` +

Example:

|===
`signup u/nicholas p/lee` +
Signed up: nicholas +
|===

Possible Errors:

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD` +

Example:

|===
`login u/nicholas p/lee` +
Logged in as nicholas. +
|===

Possible Errors:

|===
|`You are already logged in!` : You are already logged in and will need logout in order to login to another account. +
|`Please Login again! Invalid username or password.
 Command Format: [login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD]`: You have inserted an incorrect username or password. The login command has to be executed again +
|===

=== Logging out of an account : `logout`

*Logs user out of an account.* +
Format: `logout`

Example:

|===
`logout` +
Logged out of nicholas. +

=== Contributions to the Developer Guide

_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

=== Login Feature

==== Current Implementation

The login mechanism is facilitated by `TaskManager`, `SignupCommand`, `LoginCommand`, `LogoutCommand`, `DeleteAccountCommand`, `LoginEvent`, `GenerateHash`, `JsonLoginStorage`.
The login feature is mainly supported by the `Command` class and `account` class.
There are two types of accounts in login feature which are implemented in the `account` class: +
A normal user account and an admin account. All username and hashed password are stored in a JSON file.

image::AccountClassDiagram.png[width="180"]

The class diagram on the above illustrates the `account` class. +

In `model` class, there are methods to check for:
`loginStatus` (if the user is logged in), `adminStatus` (if the admin is logged in),
`userExists` (if the username is already taken), `accountExists` (if there is already an account created).

In this feature, there are 4 main commands.
The flow on how the commands are executed and their respective sequence diagrams will be further elaborated below: +
1. Signup and Login Command +
2. <<Logout Command>> +
3. <<DeleteAcc Command>>

==== Signup and Login Command

*`Signup Command` creates an account for the user and stores their username and password in a JSON file.* +
*`Login Command` logs in the account for the user by checking the username and password stored in the JSON file.* +
Given below is an example usage scenario of `signup`. The command word can be swapped for `login`.

|===
|Step 1. The user signs up and keys in username and password using the command `signup u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as a signup from `SignupCommand` and calls `SignupCommand`.
|Step 3. `SignupCommandParser` will parse the arguments to `SignupCommand`.
 `SignupCommand` will call the following commands which are linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getLoginStatus` to check if the user is already logged in. +
`userExists` to check if there is already an account with the same username. +
`accountExists` to check if an account has already been created. +

If the arguments passes all the commands, `newUser(user)` will be called to store
the username and hashed password in a User class.
It will then pass the User object to `JsonLoginStorage`.
|Step 4. `JsonLoginStorage` retrieves the User object to read and write Json files with the correct Json properties.
|Step 5. It will then return to `loginEvent` then to `SignupCommand` and returns the user a successful signup output.
|===

The following sequence diagram below shows the flow of `signup` and `login` respectively from Step 1 to Step 5 above.

==== Logout Command

*Logout Command logs the user out of their account.* Given below is an example usage scenario of `logout`.

|===
|Step 1. The user logs out by keying in the command `logout`.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as a logout from `LogoutCommand` and calls `LogoutCommand`.
|Step 3. `LogoutCommand` will call the following command which is linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getLoginStatus` to check if the user is already logged out. +
`getAdminStatus` to check if the admin is already logged out. +

If the arguments passes `getLoginStatus` and `getAdminStatus`, `logout` will be called in `LoginEvent`.
|Step 4. In `LoginEvent`, `getLoginStatus` and `getAdminStatus` will be set to false and will then
return to `LoginCommand` to return the user a successful logout output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `logout` from Step to Step above.

image::LogoutSequenceDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== DeleteAcc Command

*`DeleteAcc` only accessible to admins. `DeleteAcc` deletes the entire account.* Given below is an example usage scenario of `DeleteAcc`.

|===
|Step 1. The admin logs in by keying in username and password using the command `login u/admin p/admin`.
|Step 2. The admin keys in `DeleteAcc` to delete the account.
|Step 3. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as delete account
from `DeleteAccountCommand` and calls `DeleteAccountCommand`.
|Step 4. `DeleteAccountCommand` will call the following command which is linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getAdminStatus` to check if an admin is logged in. +

If the arguments passes `getAdminStatus`, `deleteAccount()` will be called in `LoginEvent`.
|Step 5. In `LoginEvent`, JsonLoginStorage's `deleteAccount()` will be called to delete the JSON file.
|Step 6. `LoginEvent` will then call `reinitialise()` to create the Json file
without any username and password stored in it. `reinitialise()` is assisted by `JsonLoginStorage` and `writeJson()`.
|Step 7. `LoginEvent` will return to `DeleteAccountCommand` and returns the user a successful login output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `deleteacc` from Step to Step above.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` works together

*Alternative 1 (current choice): `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` are in separate classes.* +
Pros: Follows OOP coding. The codes will look more organised and clean. +
Cons: Coders will have to look at both files to code or debug as both calls each other frequently. +
*Alternative 2: `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` are in the same class.* +
Pros: Easy to read and debug, all codes are in one file and thus easier for other coders to modify. +
Cons: Does not follow OOP coding. The codes in the file will look messy.

===== Aspect: How `LoginEvent` fits into the code

*Alternative 1 (current choice): `LoginEvent` is implemented into the logic.* +
Pros: The code will be efficient and effective. It will be neat and the flow will be well structured.
Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns is maintained in the code. +
Cons: Might be confusing as `LoginEvent` is used frequently.
Coders might need to fully understand how other classes work before looking at `LoginEvent`. +
*Alternative 2: `LoginEvent` is implemented on its own.* +
Pros: It would be easier for coders to visualise and debug. `LoginEvent` can still run the entire Taskmanager. +
Cons: There would be a lot of repeated and redundant codes.
Most of the functions in the `logic` component will be repeated. This will violate Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns.

===== Aspect: How the securing of password is implemented

*Alternative 1 (current choice): Create my own hashing function to secure password.* +
Pros: Hashing is a one way function. With a proper hashing design, there is no way to reverse
the hashing process to reveal the original password. +
Cons: Need to code out my own hashing function. More logic and function have to be written.
The code will be more complex. +
*Alternative 2: Use encryption library to secure password. Eg. MD5 hashing* +
Pros: Do not need to code much. Most of the function are one line. Easy to implement. +
Cons: Encryption is a two-way function. Encrypted strings can be decrypted with a proper key.
The password will not be secure. MD5 is not suitable for sensitive information.
Collisions exist with the algorithm, and there have been successful attacks against it.

In CG1112, we came up with Vincent. Vincent is a search and rescue robot designed to locate survivors. It will be tele-operated by the operator remotely though a secure connection from a remote desktop. The operator on the remote site will be presented with an environment map of Vincent, which can be used to navigate the simulated environment. The operator will use a Master Control Program (MCP) to command Vincent to move forward/backwards, turn left/right, mark the current location and start autonomous backtracking. +
