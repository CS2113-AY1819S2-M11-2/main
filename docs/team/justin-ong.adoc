== PROJECT: Student Buddy

---

== Overview

This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113/T, Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming. My team comprised 4 members, including myself, and we were tasked with morphing or enhancing the https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Addressbook Level 4 project] (AB4) by https://github.com/se-edu[SE-EDU] within *8 weeks*. We decided to morph AB4 into a task management app named *Student Buddy*.

*Student Buddy* is a desktop application tailored to the needs of students at the National University of Singapore. Specifically, it is meant for students who are comfortable with using a Command Line Interface (CLI). The use of a CLI for user input allows users to input commands more efficiently than when using a conventional user interface, thereby allowing them to better manage their tasks and their time. The app does, however, retain a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy viewing of information.

The project is written in Java, with JavaFX used to create the GUI.

== Summary of contributions

The following list is a summary of my contributions to the project *Student Buddy*:

* *Major enhancement*: added a *calendar panel* to the GUI for *easy viewing of tasks and their deadlines*.
** What it does: allows the user to view their tasks in a format that is *familiar* and *easy to read*. In addition, tasks are ordered and colour-coded by priority (high to low), allowing users to easily see which tasks are more urgent.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to quickly and easily see what tasks are due and when, facilitating better time management.
** Highlights: This enhancement piggybacks off of existing infrastructure, so future changes to underlying systems may cause the enhancement to break. It required an in-depth study of new concepts, as GUI modification was completely new to me before this project. I also wrote tests to ensure that the enhancement was working correctly.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `month` command to the app
** What it does: allows the user to change the month displayed on the calendar

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|While the AB4 project came with a User Guide, our team had to modify it extensively to match our product. For my part, I wrote about the features of my calendar panel, and how users could use it. I also wrote about my month changing feature. Below is a sample of my work._
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=calendar]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|The AB4 project also came with a Developer Guide, which we also modified to match our project. For my part, I wrote about the implementation of my calendar panel and the month changing feature. I also contributed towards cleaning up some grammar mistakes in the guide, as well as adjusting the tone and formatting to be more consistent. Below is a sample of my contributions._
