== PROJECT: Student Buddy

---

== Overview
This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113T.
The team comprises of 4 members ad we were tasked to develop a working application within 8 weeks.
We decided to morph the existing application into a task manager, called *Student Buddy*.

To comply with the module requirements, the team is constrained to start from an existing code base â€“ https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book Level 4] and the user must interact with the application via Command Line interface(CLI).

*Student Buddy* is a desktop application created for students to assist them in managing their schedule.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to *Student Buddy*.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to `sort` tasks*
** What it does: It allows the user to sort the tasks in the task list based on name, module code, date due or priority level.
** Justification: This feature improves significantly because it allows the user to organise the task list in a manner of their choosing.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis and understanding on how the different components of the task manager is involved with each other.

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored the existing Address Book Level 4 and edited the code to make a basic task manager that was used as the base of Student Buddy.

* *Minor enhancement*: created a `daysRemaining` function to find number of days remaining till the task is due and gave colour codes depending on how much days are left.

* *Minor enhancement*: created `findname`, `findmodule`, `finddate` and `findpriority` commands to be able to search not only by task name but by other variables.

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=Khairul[Reposense]

//tag::find[]
=== Locating tasks by name: `findname`, `fn`

Finds tasks with names containing any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findname KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `fn KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `HOMEWORK` will match `homework`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2113 Tutorial` will match `Tutorial CS2113`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Assignments` will not match `Assignment`
* Tasks matching at least one of the keywords will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `CS2113 Assignment` will return `CS2113 Homework`, `Assignment 2`
****

Examples:

* `findname Project Tutorial` +
Returns all task with names containing `Project` or `Tutorial`.
* `fn Project Lab Report` +

=== Locating tasks by module code: `findmodule`, `fm`

Finds tasks with module codes containing any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findmodule KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `fm KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `CS2113T` will match `cs2113t`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2113T CS2101` will match `CS2101 CS2113`
* Only the module code is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `CS2113T` will not match `CS2113`
****

Examples:

* `findmodule CS2113T` +
Returns all tasks containing the module code `CS2113T`.
* `fm CS2113T CS2101` +
Returns all tasks containing the module code `CS2113T` or `CS2101`.

=== Locating tasks by date: `finddate`, `fd`

Finds tasks with dates containing any of the given keywords. +
Format: `finddate KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `fd KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `03-03 21-03` will match `21-03 03-03`
****

Examples:

* `finddate 20-03` +
Returns all task with date 20-03.
* `fd 20-03 30-03` +
Returns all task with date 20-03 or 30-03.

=== Locating tasks by priority code: `findpriority`, `fp`

Finds tasks with priority code containing any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findpriority KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `fp KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `1 2` will match `2 1`
****

Examples:

* `findpriority 1` +
Returns all task with priority code 1.
* `fp 1 3` +
Returns all task with priority code 1 or 3.
//end::find[]

//tag::sort[]
=== Sorting the task list : `sort`, `s`

Sorts the task list in Student Buddy according to an input parameter.
Format: `sort PARAMETER` or `s PARAMETER`

****
* Sorts the task list according to the `PARAMETER`.
* The parameter *must be one of the following* `name, module, date, priority`.
* You can also use the initials of the parameter i.e `n`, `m`, `d` or `p`.
****

Examples:

* `sort module` +
Sorts the task list lexicographically by module code.
* `s priority` +
Sorts the task list in descending order by priority.

=== Deleting Overdue Tasks : `deleteoverdue`, `delod` `[coming in v2.0]`

// tag::task[]
=== Task Feature

Current Implementation

The task list is created by refactoring the existing code in the https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book Level 4]

The class diagram below illustrates the *task* class.

// end::task[]

// tag::sorttask[]
=== Sort Task List Feature

==== Current Implementation

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `TaskManager`, `Model` and `SortTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

|===
|Step 1. The user keys in `sort ATTRIBUTE`, the `SortCommandParser` will trim the command to get the attribute.
|Step 2. If the attribute is valid, it will then create a new `SortCommand` and execute with the given attribute.
|Step 3. `SortCommand` will then call `ModelManager#sortTask(toSortBy)`.
|Step 4. It will then call `TaskManager#sortTask(attribute)`.
Then we convert the relevant attributes of the tasks in the Task List to string to compare using `string#compareTo()`.
|Step 5. Then, we use `setTasks()` in `UniqueTaskList` to update the Task List.
After returning the sorted Task List, the Task Manager is then committed.
|===

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates how the sort mechanism functions. More specifically, sorting by module code.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write a class separately for handling the sorting of the task list.
** Pros: Easy to read and debug, Follows OOP coding and thus easier for other coders to modify.
** Cons: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Write a method for each attribute in `TaskManager`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Does not follow OOP coding.


// end::sorttask[]

// tag::overdue[]
=== [Proposed] Delete overdue
==== Proposed Implementation
Using the existing `daysRemaining` variable, upon entering `DeleteOverdue` in the command line, the command will iterate through all the tasks and check the value of `daysRemaining`.
If it is less than 0, the command will call the `DeleteCommand` to delete the overdue task.

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: How the delete overdue command executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write the command such that whenever there is an overdue task, it will call the `delete` command.
** Pros: Easy to use as it does not require changing the existing code much.
** Cons: Will need to iterate through all the tasks.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new class to store all overdue tasks that updates itself whenever a task is overdue.
** Pros: Faster as it does not require iterating through all tasks.
** Cons: Requires more space to store all the overdue tasks
// end::overdue[]
